## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##The raw data used in this project is sourced from text files from: https://github.com/slevkoff/ECON386REPO/tree/master/Data%20Cleaning%20Project/Task%201

##Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years by UCI. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

##The purpose of our project is to use a large set of training data (with inputs and outputs) to creaste a model to prdict, out-of-sample on the test dataset (a smaller set of data with input features only).

###Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
#Bring in the training (larger) file
proj2trainfull <- read.csv("training.csv")

#View the dataset if desired.
View(proj2trainfull)
head(proj2trainfull)

#Remove unnecessary rows and columns.
proj2cleanstep1 <- filter(proj2trainfull, new_window == "no")
proj2cleanstep2 <- proj2cleanstep1[, colSums(is.na(proj2cleanstep1)) == 0] 

#Partition the training file provided into a training and testing subset.
#Set seed for reproducibility.set.seed(0386)

trainingRowIndexProj2 <-sample(1:nrow(proj2cleanstep2), size = .7*nrow(proj2cleanstep2))
trainFinal <-proj2cleanstep2[trainingRowIndexProj2, ]
testFinal <-proj2cleanstep2[-trainingRowIndexProj2, ]

#We now have trainFinal and testFinal, to train and validate our models.

##Also, in order to get the output data into numeric values, we used Excel as an intermediary and classified A as 1, B as 2 and so fourth.
